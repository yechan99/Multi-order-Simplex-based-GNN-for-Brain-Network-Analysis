## Abstract

A brain network is defined by wiring anatomical regions in the brain with structural and functional relationships. It has an intricate topology with handful early features/biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, which emphasize the importance of analyzing connectomic features alongside region-wise assessments. Various graph neural network (GNN) approaches have been developed for brain network analysis, however, they mainly focused on node-centric analyses often treating edge features as an auxiliary information (i.e., adjacency matrix) to enhance node representations. In response, we propose a method that explicitly learns node and edge embeddings for brain network analysis. Introducing a dual aggregation framework, our model incorporates a novel spatial graph convolution layer with an incidence matrix. Enabling concurrent node-wise and edge-wise information aggregation for both nodes and edges, this framework captures the intricate node-edge relationships within the brain. Demonstrating superior performance on the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, our model effectively handles the complex topology of brain networks. Furthermore, our model yields interpretable results with Grad-CAM, selectively identifying brain Regions of Interest (ROIs) and connectivities associated with AD, aligning with prior AD literature.
